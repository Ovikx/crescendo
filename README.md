As a Modacity user, I feel like the free version of the app doesn't provide good statistics and organization tools (the paid version lacks this almost entirely). The aim of this project is to provide musicians with the tools to practice and organize repertoire, minus the paywalls. This project is mainly a way for me to familiarize myself with React Native and all the related tools.
